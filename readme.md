```
In purely functional programming you don't tell the computer what to do as such
but rather you tell it what stuff is. The factorial of a number is the product
of all the numbers from 1 to that number, the sum of a list of numbers is the
first number plus the sum of all the other numbers, and so on. You express that
in the form of functions. You also can't set a variable to something and then
set it to something else later. If you say that a is 5, you can't say it's
something else later because you just said it was 5. What are you, some kind of
liar? So in purely functional languages, a function has no side-effects.

- Haskell is lazy
- infinite data structures
- statically typed
